# Test Automation Architecture Project

This repository **does not contain functional code**. Its purpose is to serve as a reference for a **scalable and well-structured architecture** for test automation projects, inspired by the framework presented in the following video and repository:

- Video: [YouTube - PolarisLiteTestFramework Scalability Test Automation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_4LZgUZ5C4)
- Original repository: [AutomateThePlanet/PolarisLiteTestFramework (scalability-test-automation)](https://github.com/AutomateThePlanet/PolarisLiteTestFramework/tree/scalability-test-automation)

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to organize folders, namespaces, and classes to achieve a clean, maintainable, and scalable architecture in test automation projects.  
**It does not include business logic, implementations, or functional examples.**

## Structure

The folder and file structure follows best practices observed in the original framework, separating responsibilities into different layers and modules (e.g., Core, Pages, Elements, Services, Api, Desktop, Mobile, Web, etc.).

## Usage

This repository can be used as a template or starting point for new automation projects, allowing teams to focus on implementing their specific test logic on top of a solid architectural foundation.

## Note

**This project is not functional.**  
It does not contain executable code or test implementations. Its sole value is to serve as an example of organization and architecture for a test automation framework.
